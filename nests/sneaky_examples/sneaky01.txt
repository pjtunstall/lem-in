#Like audit example01 except with only one ant,
#and the a-m link cut, blocking path tEam.
#Originally my program found hne, then tEam,
#which would be fine because the short path
#hne would still be available. But with this
#modification, it would find hne, then 0onhAck
#in the residual graph, to make the two longer
#paths 0one and hAck. So unless the search for
#paths is stopped at one path, this example
#would fail to find the optimal solution for
#just one ant.
